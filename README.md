# AFT — Another Frequency Thing

AFT is a statically-typed, LLVM-backed educational compiler project implementing a complete DSL pipeline, including lexing, parsing, AST construction, semantic analysis, and IR code generation.

## 1. Project Overview

AFT (Another Frequency Thing) is a small, imperative, function-based DSL designed to demonstrate end-to-end compiler construction.

- The implementation includes:

  - Lexer implemented using Flex

  - Parser built with Bison

  - AST generator with structured node hierarchy

  - Semantic analyzer (scope management, type checking, symbol tables)

  - LLVM-based backend for IR generation

  - Runtime library implementing built-in language functions

  - AST Printer for visualization and debugging

  - Comprehensive testcases (syntax + semantics + general + builtins)

- The repository also contains a Makefile that builds all compiler components and tools.

## 2. Building the Project

Requirements
AFT depends on the following external tools and libraries:

### Component - Purpose : 

- LLVM (16–19) : Target backend, IR builder, system libraries
- Flex : Lexical analysis
- Bison : Grammar and parser generation
- Clang/LLVM Toolchain : Linking, executing IR
- Standard C++ compiler (clang++ recommended) : Core implementation

# Build Instructions
To build the entire toolchain (compiler + AST printer):
```
make
```
This produces:

**main** – the AFT compiler

**ast_printer** – AST visualization tool

3. Usage

- To compile and run .af files we can use the script in the main directory :
```
./aft.sh <file_name>.af
./a.out
```

- Compile an AFT program into LLVM IR

```
./main program.af -o program.ll
```

- Execute using LLVM interpreter

```
llc program.ll
```

- Compile to a native binary

```
clang program.ll -o program
./program
```

- View the Abstract Syntax Tree
```
./ast_printer program.af
```

4. Language Features 

- Primitive types: **int(unsigned and signed), bool, vector, float, complex, string**
- Variables and assignments
- Arithmetic and boolean expressions
- Conditional control flow: **if, else if, else**
- Iterative control flow: **for, while**
- First-class functions
- Typed parameters
- Typed return values
- Recursive calls
